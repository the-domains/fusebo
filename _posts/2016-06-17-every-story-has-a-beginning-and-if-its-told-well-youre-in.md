# EVERY STORY HAS A BEGINNING AND IF IT'S TOLD WELL, YOU'RE IN NO RUSH TO GET TO THE END

It's been 8 years since FUSEBO was born, and yet it still feels like yesterday when it all began.

In the time that has elapsed, we haven't, in the typical start up fashion, tried to multiply the team and increase business multifold every year. We've remained small, and strategically so. A team of inspired people that hold latent energy that sometimes even takes us by surprise.

Time really does fly. (Except when you're waiting by the microwave for your cup of tea to reheat) Some 100 odd projects later, we have been left with many interesting insights and recognition of invaluable patterns in the usability and design consulting landscape. Servicing verticals spanning telecom, education, healthcare, retail, travel and IT for customers from right across the street to half way across the world, our expertise in the space is hard earned. We've worked with clients large and small: From start ups with sketchy plans, limited resources and infinite passion, to corporate juggernauts with well bounded project plans and seemingly limitless budgets --- we've seen them all. Our maturity and experience in the interaction design space gives us the ability to predict briefing outcomes early on and swiftly guide the solution in the right direction.

Okay, so why the name FUSEBO?

It all started as FIRSTusable and then, somewhere along the way, our interests in psychology, philosophy and technology led us to create this inhouse lab of sorts, which we called Placebo: the lab of life. Unfortunately, a name that honest doesn't always go down too well with the world, or the psychiatrists and other specialists we work with. So we thought about it, and married FIRSTusable (also referred to as 'FUSE' by many) with Placebo to create FUSEBO. Simple isn't it? Of course, we love talking about the transition and what our [brand story][0] is all about.

If you'd like to know more about FUSEBO, [get in touch][1] and let's talk.

Here are some choicest phrases we've saved from some of our client interactions:

"We're small now- so gives us your lowest consulting rates, and we'll make this thing big together!"

"I've built and sold over a dozen successful start ups in the Bay Area but I am now strapped for cash- what are your best rates?"

"We want something that's never been done in the space before. It's got to look like a million bucks, be at least 36 months ahead of its time and yet be familiar and easy to use and yes, it's got offer it all in less than 3 clicks!"

"Make it look like it was designed by Apple (in California) and built by talented chaps (in India)."

"Is that a limited edition Mont Blanc in your pocket?"

"See those links I sent you. You'll get the idea. Send me a quote."

"How many man hours would you take to come up with an idea in your head that nobody has ever dreamt up (in the Lead Management space) and how much would the man hour rate for that be?"

"We have 2 weeks to launch- make it look good. We've heard you guys are good at that stuff!"

"Budgets aren't a constraint really- we just want the best user experience money can buy. So give us your most competent rates- we've 7 quotations to choose from."

Yes, our clients are only human and we love them for that. Understandably, almost all of FUSEBO's work thus far has been secured through word of mouth and referrals and the accidental social introduction that blossoms into 6 months of consulting work.
